    Implementation of the triplet loss as defined by formula

    Arguments:
    y_true -- true labels, required when you define a loss in Keras, you don't need it in this function.
    y_pred -- python list containing three objects:
            anchor -- the encodings for the anchor images, of shape (None, 128)
            positive -- the encodings for the positive images, of shape (None, 128)
